The cortex_m_generic_cortex-m4_default folder is generated by running the file `../build_tflite_lib.sh`. However, for completeness and ease of use I have included a snapshot of this library that is built with the included submodule version of tflite-micro.

The `apply_patches.py` file is used by PlatformIO whenever a build is triggered, because the flatbuffers v2.0.6 library contains a bug that does not allow it to build. However, the current version of TFLite-Micro *expects* version 2.0.6, so we apply the manual patch seen in `flatbuffers.patch` before each build.
